<section class='post-content'><p>I&rsquo;m doing some work for a nonprofit organization with a growing email list. Last month we passed 10,000 subscribers. 
Not a massive list, but our current platform was getting a little expensive. I looked at switching to MailChimp, but
found their terms too restrictive and their service too opinionated. After doing some research I decided to check
out <a href="http://sendy.co/">Sendy</a>. Sendy is a PHP application you install on a server. It provides an interface for
using <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ses/">Amazon SES</a>. You get reports, compose tools, bounce handling, etc. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Amazon AWS for a lot more lately (static site hosting with S3, for one thing) so I decided to create an
EC2 server to host Sendy. Combining EC2 with SES means significant cost savings and a lot more flexibility. Here&rsquo;s a quick
guide for getting Sendy up and running on an Amazon EC2 instance. </p>

<p>I wanted this instance to be available on a subdomain: sendy.mydomain.com. When you purchase Sendy you have to
tell them what domain Sendy will live at, but it&rsquo;s easy to change this later. Assuming you have things squared away with
the Sendy folks, the first step will be setting up a subdomain. To accomplish this with Route 53,
click on the hosted zone for your domain in the Route 53 control panel. Then click Go To Record Sets, then Create Record Set. 
Create an A record with the name of sendy.mydomain.com, then Save Record Set. You&rsquo;ll come back to this later and enter
the Elastic IP for the Sendy instance in the Value field. </p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to get an EC2 instance running. Amazon has good documentation. Be sure to go through the
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html">setup guide</a> before you go through
the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html">main EC2 guide</a>. Use an Ubuntu image. You might want
to specify another EBS volume for the Sendy database. Since my instance is dedicated to Sendy I just kept everything under one volume. 
Another thing to consider when setting up your EC2 instance is turning on termination protection. </p>

<p>After going through the Amazon guides you should be able to connect to your instance with SSH. 
    ssh -i path/to/key/file ubuntu@amazon-instance-public-dns</p>

<p>Once connected, update your instance:
    sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade</p>

<p>Next, as specified in the Ubuntu <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP">LAMP docs</a>, install a LAMP server:
    sudo tasksel install lamp-server</p>

<p>Connect to the MySQL database using the password supplied during the taskel install:
    mysql -u root -p</p>

<p>Create a database for Sendy:
    CREATE DATABASE sendy;</p>

<p>You should have a basic LAMP stack running at this point. If you go to the public DNS address provided by the EC2 web console, you should see
the basic Apache success method. </p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ll set up an Elastic IP, associate it with the instance, fix Route 53, and all the basic setup will be complete. In the EC2 web console, click
Elastic IPs (under Network &amp; Security). Allocate a new address and associate it with your Sendy instance. Then, go back to Route 53 and put that new IP
address in the Value field for the A name record you created for Sendy (sendy.mydomain.com). After this you should be able to see the Apache success page
via sendy.mydomain.com.</p>

<p>The next few steps involve getting your stack properly configured for Sendy. Enable mod_rewrite:
    sudo a2enmod rewrite</p>

<p>install curl:
    sudo apt-get install php5-curl</p>

<p>and restart Apache:
    sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</p>

<p>Note, this did not work for me for restarting Apache:
    sudo service apache2 restart</p>

<p>When I was getting this all working I saw a lot of things on Stack Overflow about editing the php.ini file to point to the curl library and turn on mod_rewrite.
I didn&rsquo;t have to do that, but your mileage may vary. If you are having problems getting Sendy to work I&rsquo;d look at php.ini. In my version of Ubuntu (13.10) php.ini
lives at /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini.</p>

<p>I got this far and then had all kinds of problems until I realized I had to modify the Apache2 configuration file to allow the mod_overwrite extension. 
The latter is required by Sendy. I don&rsquo;t claim to understand it, but it&rsquo;s related to Apache redirecting. So, you need to look at 
/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf. Since this instance is dedicated to Sendy I just made my changes to the default configuration. Put this inside
the VirtualHost *:80 if you are changing the default file like me, or in the proper section if you have more than one virtual host. </p>
<div class="highlight plaintext"><table style="border-spacing: 0"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl" style="text-align: right"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>&lt;Directory /var/www/html/&gt;
  AllowOverride All
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

<p>Ok, now you should be ready to follow the Sendy docs to finish the setup. Install Sendy in /var/wwww/html - not sure if that&rsquo;s required but Sendy support staff
  suggested this in a form post. My working configuration, on which this is based, is installed in /var/www/html. The docs tell you to edit the config file 
  locally before transferring the Sendy director to the server. I found it easier to use wget and S3 to get the original zip archive on the sever (use
  apt-get to install unzip), and then use vim via ssh to edit the config file. </p>
